## TOOLING RULE

**OneDrive safety**: This repo is on an OneDrive path. **Never** use Edit/Write directly on `.py` files.
Use the safe patching pattern (temp script → CRLF normalize → write_bytes). See [docs/tooling-issues.md](docs/tooling-issues.md).
The PreToolUse hook (`.claude/hooks/check_file_edit.py`) enforces this automatically.

> **macOS / Desktop path note**: The hook only fires on OneDrive-rooted paths. Enrico's Desktop path (`/Users/enricomanfron/Desktop/Thesis Maniflod/`) is NOT an OneDrive path — Edit/Write on `.py` files work normally here.

---

## BUILD COMMANDS (Phase 3 — not yet set up)

Once the LaTeX pipeline is built (Phase 3):
```bash
make pdf      # Markdown → LaTeX → PDF (build/thesis.pdf)
make check    # Run integrity gates (scripts/check_integrity.py)
make figures  # Regenerate all figures (generate_figures.py)
```

---

## INTEGRITY GATES (Phase 4 — not yet set up)

| Gate | When | Checks |
|------|------|--------|
| Gate 1 (Pre-Draft) | Before prose expansion | Section completeness, page budget (120p), skeleton approved |
| Gate 2 (Post-Draft) | After first full draft | APA7 citations, figure references, NotebookLM cross-check |
| Gate 3 (Pre-Submission) | Before final PDF | 7-mode AI failure checklist, CBS compliance, AI disclosure, 49-citation validation |

Run Gate 3 with `make check`. Run Gate 1/2 manually using [docs/compliance/integrity_checklist.md](docs/compliance/integrity_checklist.md) (TODO Phase 4).

## KNOWN TODOs / FROZEN DECISIONS

> These are deliberate choices. **Do not "fix" these without explicit instruction from Enrico or Brian.**

- **Measurement model**: DSR (Design Science Research) methodology confirmed — do not suggest alternatives
- **RAM constraint**: 8GB hard limit on all System A models — no exceptions, no suggestions to "just use more RAM"
- **Writing Agent**: produces ONLY bullet points — never full prose. Prose requires human sign-off
- **Phase transitions**: every phase requires explicit human approval before proceeding
- **RQs v2**: currently the canonical version — do not modify without flagging a change
- **System A vs System B**: these are separate systems. Never modify System A logic from System B agents
- **ADR-001/002/003**: open decisions — do not implement Phase 3 before these are resolved
- **Global LightGBM v2 (Tweedie)**: current best model at 22.5% median MAPE — do not replace without benchmarking
- **No em dashes in prose**: rewrite using commas, semicolons, colons, or subordinate clauses (hyphens in compound adjectives permitted)

## PROJECT

**Description**: Master's thesis (Business Administration & Data Science) at Copenhagen Business School (CBS), in collaboration with Manifold AI. The project designs, implements, and evaluates a multi-agent framework that transitions Manifold's AI Colleagues system from descriptive analytics to predictive decision-support.

**Objective**: Answer the main research question — *How can an AI agent transition from descriptive analytics to predictive decision-support in a resource-constrained cloud environment (8GB RAM)?* — through an original framework integrating LLM orchestration, lightweight machine learning, and multi-criteria decision synthesis.

**Target users**: Manifold AI internal analysts and their business clients (Danish retailers and consumer goods manufacturers).

**Deadline**: 15 May 2026 — 120-page thesis (group, 2 students).

**Hard constraint**: 8GB total RAM. Every architectural decision must be justified against this constraint.

---

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS
> v2 — updated 2026-03-14. Full history in docs/literature/rq_evolution.md

**Main RQ**: How can AI systems be designed to provide reliable predictive decision-support in real-world business environments under computational constraints?

- **SRQ1**: Which predictive modelling approaches provide the best balance between forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency under realistic cloud resource constraints?
- **SRQ2**: How can a multi-agent architecture coordinate predictive models and heterogeneous data signals to generate actionable managerial recommendations?
- **SRQ3**: To what extent does additional contextual information improve the predictive and decision-support capabilities of AI systems?
- **SRQ4**: How does the proposed predictive AI system compare to traditional descriptive analytics approaches used in business intelligence systems?

> ⚠️ RQs are still evolving — Literature Review Agent has an explicit mandate to propose refinements. See docs/literature/rq_evolution.md for open questions.

## AGENT ARCHITECTURE

> ⚠️ TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS — do not confuse them.
> Full documentation: `docs/system_architecture_report.md`

### SYSTEM A — AI Research Framework (`/ai_research_framework/`)
*The experimental architecture being evaluated in the thesis. Appears in Chapters 5–8.*

| Agent | File | SRQ | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Research Coordinator** | `core/coordinator.py` | Orchestrator | ✅ LangGraph StateGraph |
| **Data Assessment Agent** | `agents/data_assessment_agent.py` | SRQ1–4 precondition | ✅ Complete — Phase 1 done (77 brands, 42 periods, DVH EXCL. HD) |
| **Forecasting Agent** | `agents/forecasting_agent.py` | SRQ1 | ✅ Complete — 6 models + ensemble; Global LGB v2 (Tweedie) 22.5% median MAPE |
| **Synthesis Agent** | `agents/synthesis_agent.py` | SRQ2 | ⬜ Partial (API implemented — Phase 5 pending) |
| **Validation Agent** | `agents/validation_agent.py` | SRQ1–4 | ⬜ Pending (Phase 6 — requires Phase 5 complete) |

**Key model files (standalone runners, not class-based):**
- `agents/forecasting_agent.py` — per-brand benchmark (Ridge, LightGBM, XGBoost, ARIMA, Prophet + Ensemble)
- `agents/global_model.py` — Global LightGBM v1 (28.2% median MAPE)
- `agents/global_model_v2.py` — Global LightGBM v2, Tweedie loss (22.5% median MAPE) ← **current best**
- `agents/test_evaluation.py` — held-out test set evaluation (Sep 2025–Mar 2026)
- `data/preprocessing.py` — Nielsen preprocessing pipeline (feature engineering, train/val/test split)

**Hard constraint**: ≤ 8 GB RAM. Sequential model execution. LangGraph TypedDict state.

### SYSTEM B — Thesis Production System (`/thesis_production_system/`)
*Internal tooling for writing the thesis. NOT the research contribution. NOT described in the thesis.*

| Agent | File | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Thesis Coordinator** | `core/coordinator.py` | Plan→Execute→Critic loop | ✅ |
| **Planner Agent** | `agents/planner_agent.py` | TaskPlan (JSON) from state | ✅ |
| **Critic Agent** | `agents/critic_agent.py` | Validate agent outputs | ✅ |
| **Literature Agent** | `agents/literature_agent.py` | Corpus management, scraping | ✅ Partial |
| **Writing Agent** | `agents/writing_agent.py` | Bullet points only (never prose) | ✅ |
| **Compliance Agent** | `agents/compliance_agent.py` | CBS formal checks | ✅ |
| **Diagram Agent** | `agents/diagram_agent.py` | Graphviz + Matplotlib figures | ✅ |
| **Experiment Tracking Agent** | `agents/experiment_tracking_agent.py` | Registry + summary | ✅ |
| **Results Visualization Agent** | `agents/results_visualization_agent.py` | Data-driven charts | ✅ |
| **Results Tables Agent** | `agents/results_tables_agent.py` | Markdown tables for thesis | ✅ |

#### OutlineAgent (via thesis-structuring skill)

**Skill location**: `.claude/skills/thesis-structuring/`
**Slash command**: `/update-outline`
**Triggered by**: User invocation or PlannerAgent P2 pre-check (see below)

**Role**: Sole agent responsible for `docs/thesis/outline.md`. No other agent writes to this file.
Reads thesis state and context → decides whether outline needs updating → writes updated outline.
Never writes prose or bullet content.

**Reads**:
- `docs/thesis/outline.md`
- `docs/tasks/thesis_state.json`
- `docs/thesis/sections/*.md`
- `.claude/agents/thesis-writer.md` lines 154–169 (page budgets)
- `docs/context.md`

**Writes**:
- `docs/thesis/outline.md`
- `docs/thesis/sections/{chapter_id}.md` stubs only (status: `no_bullets`)

#### APA Citation Agent (via apa-citation skill)

**Skill location**: `.claude/skills/apa-citation/`
**Slash command**: `/cite`
**Triggered by**: User invokes `/cite`, pastes a _REV or _REV-brian note, provides a DOI, or says "cite this" / "add this reference" / "format this in APA"

**Role**: Sole agent responsible for `docs/thesis/references.md`. No other agent writes to this file directly.
Formats APA 7 citations from any input source (Obsidian notes, DOIs, raw data), verifies via NotebookLM, checks for duplicates, and appends to the references list.

**Reads**:
- User-provided input (_REV note, DOI, raw metadata)
- `docs/thesis/references.md` (duplicate check)
- `docs/thesis/sections/{chapter_id}.md` (insertion target, if specified)

**Writes**:
- `docs/thesis/references.md` (appends new entry — alphabetical order)
- `docs/thesis/sections/{chapter_id}.md` (inserts in-text citation, if section specified)

**Edge case rules**: `.claude/skills/apa-citation/references/apa7-rules.md`

---

#### PlannerAgent P2 pre-check (scheduling rule amendment)

> **[P2 pre-check]** Before scheduling WritingAgent for a chapter, verify that chapter
> has a structural skeleton approved in `docs/thesis/outline.md`.
> If the chapter has no skeleton entry → run `/update-outline` first.
> WritingAgent must not draft bullets for a structurally undefined chapter.

---

**Core architectural rules**:
- System A = research subject — System B never modifies System A logic
- Coordinator = sole decision-maker on task order in both systems
- **Every phase transition requires explicit human approval**
- Writing Agent produces ONLY bullet points — prose requires human sign-off

## CBS GUIDELINES

The CBS thesis guidelines PDF files are in `Thesis/Thesis Guidelines/`.
The CBS Compliance Agent must read them at session start and verify every Thesis Writing Agent output against:
- Citation format (APA 7 / CBS standard)
- Chapter and section structure
- Methodological requirements
- Word count and formatting
- Mandatory declarations (plagiarism statement, etc.)

---

## ACTIVE MCP SERVERS

| Server | Function |
|---|---|
| Local file system | Read/write docs/, CSV datasets |
| Python interpreter | ML code execution, data analysis |
| Google Colab (if active) | Notebook execution for heavy benchmarks |

```

---

## MANDATORY RULES

- Do not write code before reading this file
- Sub-agents = researchers/planners/analysts ONLY — never direct implementers
- Coordinator = sole decision-maker on task order
- **Every phase transition requires explicit human approval**
- Use `/clear` at every task change
- Use `/compact` when context exceeds 50% of the window
- Use **Opus** for architecture, literature review, and complex decisions
- Use **Sonnet** for standard development, benchmarks, and bullet point writing
- Show a brief before every phase and await approval
- Thesis Writing Agent produces ONLY bullet points — never direct prose
- Stop and request human approval before writing any thesis section
- **No em dashes (—) in any thesis prose.** Rewrite around them using commas, semicolons, colons, or subordinate clauses. Hyphens in compound adjectives (resource-constrained, data-driven) are permitted.
- Every installed package must be documented in `docs/context.md`
- `docs/thesis/outline.md` is owned exclusively by the thesis-structuring skill. PlannerAgent reads it. WritingAgent reads it. Neither writes to it.
- `docs/thesis/references.md` is owned exclusively by the APA Citation Skill (`/cite`). No agent writes to it directly.
- Major restructuring proposed by `/update-outline` requires explicit human approval before PlannerAgent may schedule any writing tasks for affected chapters.
- WritingAgent may not draft bullets for a chapter not present in `docs/thesis/outline.md`.

---

## EXPLICIT LIMITS

- **DO NOT touch**: Nielsen production database, Indeks Danmark personal data outside the local environment
- **DO NOT export data outside the local environment**: no external uploads of datasets
- **DO NOT install packages without documenting them**: install freely but always log in `docs/context.md`
- **DO NOT proceed autonomously if**:
  - An agent produces output that appears wrong or incomplete → stop, notify, await instructions
  - The Coordinator receives a sub-optimal sub-agent output → return task to agent with more specific instructions, then show result
  - A thesis section is about to be written → STOP, request approval
  - RQs change significantly → STOP, align before proceeding

---

## ERROR PROTOCOL

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Agent produces wrong/non-working output | Notify immediately, show problem with analysis, await instructions |

## RISK FLAGS

- 🔴 **High complexity**: 7-agent architecture, multi-indicator synthesis module, 3-level validation framework
- 🔴 **Tight timeline**: 15 May — ~1 month remaining for SRQ2–4 implementation + thesis writing
- 🟡 **High uncertainty**: RQs still evolving, novelty to be finalised, Indeks Danmark integration for SRQ3 not yet implemented
- 🟡 **External dependency**: Manifold AI feedback on framework design pending
- 🔒 **Security critical**: Nielsen dataset must not leave the local environment; Indeks Danmark contains survey weights
- 💥 **Context overflow risk**: Literature Review Agent over many papers, Thesis Writing Agent over 120 pages — use `/compact` aggressively

## NOTEBOOKLM INTEGRATION

**Status**: Phase 0 PASSED (2026-04-13) — auth, source add, and grounded Q&A confirmed working. Ready for Phase 1 (create 6 chapter notebooks, populate with 16 confirmed papers).

**Library**: `notebooklm-py==0.3.4` (pinned) — unofficial API, fragile by design. Manual UI fallback always available at notebooklm.google.com.

**Auth**: Run once per session expiry — `notebooklm login` (opens Chromium browser). Cookies stored at `~/.notebooklm/storage_state.json`.

**Notebook ID (Enrico's primary)**: `48697de0-f0a5-4e66-918e-531abea82c20`

**Ownership model**: Brian's Google account owns all notebooks. Enrico gets shared access via NotebookLM web UI (`notebooklm.google.com`). Only Brian runs `notebooklm-py` scripts — the API only sees notebooks owned by the authenticated account. `ingestion_manifest.json` holds Brian's notebook IDs as the single source of truth.

### Notebook Map (populate after `notebooklm login` + `notebooklm create`)

| Notebook | NotebookLM ID | Chapter focus |
|---|---|---|
| `thesis-ch2-literature` | *(pending login)* | All 16+ confirmed papers — cross-corpus QA |
| `thesis-ch3-methodology` | *(pending login)* | ML methodology papers (Tier A) |
| `thesis-ch4-models` | *(pending login)* | Forecasting + benchmark comparison papers |
| `thesis-ch5-synthesis` | *(pending login)* | Consumer signal / sentiment papers |
| `thesis-ch6-evaluation` | *(pending login)* | Calibration + evaluation methodology |
| `thesis-defense` | *(pending login)* | All papers — defense Q&A |

### Mandatory Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Never pass NotebookLM output directly to WritingAgent** without `verified: False` flag cleared by a human.
2. **All quotes** from NotebookLM must be cross-checked against the actual PDF before entering any draft.
3. **Study guides / briefing docs** = orientation only. Not citable. They inform the analyst, not the draft.
4. **Never use NotebookLM output as evidence** in the SRQ3/SRQ4 evaluation sections (quantitative results only).
5. **If notebooklm-py breaks** → fall back to manual UI. All notebooks remain accessible there. Zero production capability lost.

### Citation Format (when NotebookLM-sourced)

```
[Claim] (Author, Year, p. X — verified via NotebookLM citation, PDF confirmed)
```
`PDF confirmed` tag is mandatory before final submission.

### Approved Workflow Patterns

- **Pattern A** (Literature QA): Ask → get answer + citation passage → flag as `[NOTEBOOKLM — VERIFY]` → human confirms against PDF
- **Pattern B** (Study Guide): Generate → cache to `docs/literature/guides/` → flag as `[SUMMARY — NOT VERBATIM]`
- **Pattern C** (Quote Verification): Writing Agent flags claim → NotebookLM locates passage → human confirms
- **Pattern D** (Defense Prep): Ask defense questions → get grounded answers + challenges → human reviews

### Source Ingestion

Papers live in `papers/<chapter>/`. Run `scripts/notebooklm_ingestion.py` to sync new PDFs to notebooks.
Manifest at `papers/ingestion_manifest.json` — check before adding (idempotency).

## REV AGENT — Inline Activation Rule

**REV (Research Evaluator)** is a dedicated internal agent for transforming academic paper content into structured Obsidian notes.

**Activation**: Any message that begins with `_REV` (underscore + REV, case-sensitive) triggers the REV agent exclusively.

**When `_REV` is detected:**
- Ignore all other instructions and context for that message
- Act as REV: produce only the structured Markdown note using the template defined in `.claude/commands/REV.md`
- Do NOT create files, do NOT add explanations, do NOT save anything
- Output the Markdown block directly in chat so the user can copy it into Obsidian

**Also available as**: `/REV` slash command (loads `.claude/commands/REV.md`)

---

## REV-BRIAN AGENT — Inline Activation Rule

**REV-brian** is Brian's personal variant of REV, using his own Obsidian vault property conventions and template structure.

**Activation**: Any message that begins with `_REV-brian` (case-sensitive) triggers REV-brian exclusively.

**When `_REV-brian` is detected:**
- Ignore all other instructions and context for that message
- Act as REV-brian: produce only the structured Markdown note using the template defined in `.claude/commands/REV-brian.md`
- Do NOT create files, do NOT add explanations, do NOT save anything
- Output the Markdown block directly in chat so Brian can copy it into his Obsidian vault (`Thesis/papers/`)
- Include the `%%FILE NAME: ...%%` comment at the top so Brian knows what to name the file

**Also available as**: `/REV-brian` slash command (loads `.claude/commands/REV-brian.md`)

---

## THESIS WRITER AGENT — Slash Command

**`/write-section <chapter_id>`** converts an approved bullet-point skeleton into CBS-compliant academic prose and writes it to `Thesis/thesis_draft.docx`.

**Activation**: `/write-section ch1_introduction` (or any valid chapter ID)

**Mandatory workflow** (never skip steps):
1. Read bullet file — confirm status is `bullets_approved` (not `bullets_draft`)
2. Generate prose draft — show in chat with character count estimate
3. **Citation verification** — NotebookLM verifies every citation is real and accurate (notebook ID: `48697de0-f0a5-4e66-918e-531abea82c20`)
4. **Compliance check** — CBS Compliance Agent validates: APA 7, structure, page budget, mandatory sections
5. **Human approval gate** — show draft + citation report + compliance report, wait for explicit OK
6. Write to Word — `Thesis/thesis_draft.docx` — update section status

**File**: `.claude/commands/write-section.md` + `.claude/agents/thesis-writer.md`
**Word dependency**: `python-docx` (install if missing, log in `docs/context.md`)
**NotebookLM notebook ID**: `48697de0-f0a5-4e66-918e-531abea82c20` (always run `notebooklm use <id>` at session start)

**Hard rules**:
- NEVER write prose without human approval
- NEVER skip compliance check
- NEVER fabricate citations — use `[CITATION NEEDED]` if source unknown
- NEVER claim Nielsen/Indeks Danmark results unless Phase 1 confirmed complete ✅ (Phase 1 IS complete)
